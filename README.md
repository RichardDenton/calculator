# Javascript Calculator
A simple calculator implemented in HTML and Javascript as part of the Odin Project [Curriculum.](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/calculator)

The calculator can be used either by clicking the buttons or by using the keyboard.
* Escape activates the Clear button
* Backspace activates the Delete button
* Enter or '=' activates the '=' button
* Numbers and operators are all linked to the corresponding keyboard keys

Creating the calculator allowed me to practice the Javascript fundamentals and get more experience with event listeners and DOM manipulation.

The keyboard is live at [https://RichardDenton.github.io/calculator]
